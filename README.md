# FootNet_tf
This codebase accompanies our paper about the development of a deep learning-based emulator of measurement footprints.
The repository contains two files:
* The ``footnet.py`` file contains the function to build the deep learning model, the data loader, and the transformations applied on the input and output fields.
* The ``training_script.ipynb`` demonstrates the setup of the training loop.
